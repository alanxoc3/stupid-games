Q. Do we want a center coordinate that offsets the x and y coordinate, so that the x and y pretends to be the centered coordinate.
A. Yes, we do. That would be useful. We would need to have a center method as well... probably...

The other question is how would this offset center thing work?
I suppose this partly goes to the implementation part.

The default x and y could be up to the user, or specified at the top left corner, the width and height. Then the offset could be coordinates going from the top left 

Q. How would we check if the current "thing" is an enemy or not.
A. Have the type ids of each class in the constant file be close in number, then have a function that returns true if the type inherits that class.
